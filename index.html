<h1>Transformation Imperative</h1>
     
      <p>Digital survival: The transformation imperative.When you hear the words digital transformation, it is highly likely that digital marketing comes to mind. The reason behind the same is owing to the fact that a majority of digital transformation discussions revolve around marketing metrics. The likes of page views, Clicks and press mentions. As much as marketing is relevant to a business, there is more to digital transformation than just promotions.</p>

       <p>The sole way to gain full benefits from digital transformation across all the departments of any organization is through rethinking on existing business models. Genuine digital transformation - not the coating of marketing, but the actual thing - has become a business imperative. More than half of the Fortune 500 have vanished in the last decade signifying the need for parties to change.</p>
